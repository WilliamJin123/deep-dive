A router or passthrough team is just a team that delegates tasks but does not do any additional processing on the input or the output

essentially the team leader does nothing except routing

This means setting both respond_directly=True and determine_input_for_members=False

Interesting design pattern that would be useful in some contexts (structed IO w/ Pydantic, more rigid structure)

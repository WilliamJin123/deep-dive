***LangChain / Smith / Graph ***

The question: Why not just use APIS?

So far I have just been rawdogging the apis, and the input output pipeline. This is now an experiment with LangChain to see how we can do this with less code and more abstraction.

The gist I'm getting is that if I already understand it all, I should just use langchain for speed and convenience. 

I'd say I have a pretty good knowledge base, so this seems pretty useful.

Next level for exploration is MCP server stuff (no clue how that works)

Will be learning from course:

## 10-31

Finished the intro, the pipe seems very intuitive, looks good to me, need to figure out how to organize code in diff files in real projects (for easy viewing, lots of consts for prompts)

Wtf is langSmith? We will see...
